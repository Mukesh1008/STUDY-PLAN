    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as a one-page scroller with a sticky navigation bar for quick access to key study areas. The structure is thematic, mirroring the syllabus: 1) Introduction to OT, 2) OT Security Architecture, 3) Vulnerability & Threats, 4) Industrial Control Systems (ICS), and 5) IoT/Cloud & Best Practices. This non-linear, task-oriented structure allows a student to jump directly to a weak area, maximizing last-minute study efficiency. The interactive elements (tabs and expandable details for questions) are chosen to break down complex information and provide immediate feedback, aiding rapid learning. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - OT vs IT comparison: Report Info -> Distinction between IT and OT -> Goal: Compare -> Viz/Method: Table with two columns -> Interaction: None -> Justification: A table is the clearest way to present a direct comparison of features.
        - OT Systems & Protocols: Report Info -> Overview of OT systems -> Goal: Organize -> Viz/Method: HTML/CSS diagram with Unicode arrows -> Interaction: None -> Justification: A simple visual flow makes the abstract architecture of OT systems easy to understand.
        - Security Threats: Report Info -> Common threats -> Goal: Inform (detailed) -> Viz/Method: Tabbed interface -> Interaction: User clicks tabs to reveal content -> Justification: Tabs prevent overwhelming the user with a wall of text and allow focused study on one threat category at a time.
        - Questions & Answers: Report Info -> Key exam topics -> Goal: Review -> Viz/Method: Expandable questions using <details> tags -> Interaction: User clicks to reveal answers -> Justification: This pattern efficiently hides detailed answers, allowing for a clean, scannable page and active recall.

                        <p class="mb-2"><strong>Operational Technology (OT)</strong> is a category of hardware and software that monitors and controls physical processes, devices, and events. It is used in critical infrastructure to manage industrial operations in sectors such as energy grids, water treatment, manufacturing, and transportation.

                        <p class="mb-2">OT systems are increasingly being connected to IT networks and the internet for remote management and data analysis. This convergence has exposed previously isolated OT environments to new cyber threats from the outside world, making them a more accessible and valuable target for attackers aiming to disrupt critical services.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">A DMZ is a buffer zone between the IT network and the OT network. It is designed to act as a secure intermediary layer that houses servers and systems for communication between the two networks. The DMZ prevents direct communication between IT and OT, adding a crucial layer of security and inspection to control traffic flow.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">The Purdue Model is a foundational framework that defines the different layers of a networked industrial control system. Its significance lies in providing a clear architectural guide for segmenting networks, which is the basis for implementing strong security controls. By isolating OT from IT, it helps minimize the attack surface.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">Many OT systems were built decades ago, long before the internet, and were designed to operate in isolated, air-gapped environments. As a result, they lack modern security features like encryption, strong authentication, and patch management. They cannot be easily updated and are highly vulnerable to new cyber threats.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">An SIS is an automated system designed to bring an industrial process to a safe state when predetermined conditions are violated.

                        <p class="mb-2">OT protocols (e.g., Modbus, DNP3, Profinet) are often proprietary, lack built-in security features like encryption, and are designed for deterministic, low-latency communication over industrial networks. In contrast, IT protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP) are designed for a broad range of data-centric applications and are more widely used on the internet.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">Physical security is critical because many OT attacks involve gaining physical access to devices to install malware via USB or directly connect to a PLC. Restricting physical access to control rooms, servers, and devices is a primary defense against such threats.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">An asset inventory is a complete and accurate list of all hardware and software components within an OT environment. It is a fundamental security practice because you cannot protect what you don't know you have. It helps identify legacy systems, unpatched devices, and unauthorized connections.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">Defense in depth is a security strategy that uses multiple layers of security controls to protect critical assets.

                    <div class="p-4 bg-gray-50">
                        <p class="mb-2">This principle states that in the event of a system failure or security incident, the system should default to a safe state. For example, if a security system fails, the control system should be designed to shut down safely rather than continue to operate in a compromised state.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">A vulnerability disclosure program is a process where a company publicly invites researchers to find and report security vulnerabilities in their products. This helps OT vendors find and patch flaws before they can be exploited by malicious actors, improving overall security.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">Log management involves collecting and storing logs from all OT devices and systems. Monitoring these logs for suspicious activity is crucial for detecting a breach, understanding what happened during an incident, and preventing future attacks.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">An EDR solution is designed to detect and respond to threats on individual devices (endpoints). In OT, an EDR can monitor PLCs, HMIs, and other devices for suspicious behavior, such as unauthorized changes to configurations, and automatically respond to contain the threat.</p>
