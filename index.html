    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as a one-page scroller with a sticky navigation bar for quick access to key study areas. The structure is thematic rather than linear: 1) Fundamentals (core definitions), 2) Consensus & Types (visual and table comparisons), 3) Web3 Ecosystem (diagram and core definitions), 4) Security Threats (interactive tabs for detailed deep-dives), and 5) a final Best Practices section. This non-linear, task-oriented structure allows a student with zero knowledge to either go through the material sequentially or jump directly to a weak area, maximizing last-minute study efficiency. The interactive elements (tabs, a toggle button, and expandable details for questions) are chosen to break down complex information and provide immediate feedback, aiding rapid learning. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Blockchain Properties: Report Info -> 3 Core Properties -> Goal: Inform -> Viz/Method: 3-column text layout with Unicode icons -> Interaction: None -> Justification: Clear, concise definitions are best presented as static text for easy reading.
        - Consensus Mechanisms: Report Info -> PoW vs PoS energy usage -> Goal: Compare -> Viz/Method: Bar Chart -> Interaction: Visual comparison -> Justification: A bar chart dramatically and instantly communicates the vast energy difference, which is a key takeaway. Library: Chart.js/Canvas.
        - Blockchain Types: Report Info -> Public vs Private vs Consortium -> Goal: Compare -> Viz/Method: HTML Table -> Interaction: Toggled visibility -> Justification: A table is ideal for direct comparison. Hiding it initially keeps the UI clean.
        - Web3 Ecosystem: Report Info -> Relationship between Ethereum, EVM, Smart Contracts, DApps -> Goal: Organize -> Viz/Method: HTML/CSS flowchart diagram -> Interaction: None -> Justification: A simple visual flow makes the abstract architecture easy to understand.
        - Security Attacks: Report Info -> Details of various attacks -> Goal: Inform (detailed) -> Viz/Method: Tabbed interface -> Interaction: User clicks tabs to reveal content -> Justification: Tabs prevent overwhelming the user with a wall of text and allow focused study on one attack at a time.
        - Questions & Answers: Report Info -> Key exam topics -> Goal: Review -> Viz/Method: Expandable questions using <details> tags -> Interaction: User clicks to reveal answers -> Justification: This pattern efficiently hides detailed answers, allowing for a clean, scannable page and active recall.

                        <p class="mb-2">This principle dictates that a smart contract should only be given the minimum set of permissions necessary to perform its functions. Limiting what a contract can do reduces the surface area for potential attacks if a vulnerability is found.</p>
