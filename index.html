    <!-- Chosen Palette: Dark Midnight -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as a one-page scroller with a sticky navigation bar for quick access to key study areas. The structure is thematic, mirroring the first half of the syllabus: 1) Introduction to OT, 2) OT Security Architecture, and 3) Vulnerability & Threats. This non-linear, task-oriented structure allows a student to jump directly to a weak area, maximizing last-minute study efficiency. The interactive elements (tabs and expandable details for questions) are chosen to break down complex information and provide immediate feedback, aiding rapid learning. A new JavaScript function ensures only one question is open at a time for better focus. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - OT vs IT comparison: Report Info -> Distinction between IT and OT -> Goal: Compare -> Viz/Method: HTML Table -> Interaction: None -> Justification: A table is the clearest way to present a direct comparison of features.
        - Security Threats: Report Info -> Common threats and case studies -> Goal: Inform (detailed) -> Viz/Method: Tabbed interface -> Interaction: User clicks tabs to reveal content -> Justification: Tabs prevent overwhelming the user with a wall of text and allow focused study on one threat category at a time.
        - Questions & Answers: Report Info -> Key exam topics -> Goal: Review -> Viz/Method: Expandable questions using <details> tags -> Interaction: User clicks to reveal answers -> Justification: This pattern efficiently hides detailed answers, allowing for a clean, scannable page and active recall, while the new JavaScript logic keeps only one open for better focus.

                        <p class="mb-2">OT systems, which were once isolated, are now connected to IT networks and the internet. This connection makes them vulnerable to attacks from the outside, turning them into a high-value target for hackers who want to disrupt critical services.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">An SIS is a special, automated system designed to bring an industrial process to a safe state during an emergency. It acts as an emergency shutdown system to prevent accidents, so its security is extremely important for human safety.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">Many OT systems are old and were built before cyber threats were a concern. They lack modern security features like encryption, strong passwords, and easy updates. This makes them very vulnerable to new attacks.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">OT protocols (like Modbus and DNP3) are designed for simple, fast communication over industrial networks. They often lack built-in security features, unlike modern IT protocols (like TCP/IP) which are designed for the internet and include security.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">Physical security is key because many OT attacks involve a hacker getting physical access to a device. By controlling who can physically enter a factory floor or a control room, you can prevent many types of attacks, like planting malware via a USB drive.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">An asset inventory is a complete list of all the hardware and software in an OT environment. It is a fundamental security step because you cannot protect what you don't know you have. It helps you find old, unpatched systems and unauthorized devices.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">A **Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)** is a small, separate network that acts as a secure buffer between the IT network and the OT network. It prevents direct contact between the two, forcing all communication to go through a monitored and controlled security zone.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">The Purdue Model is a framework that divides an industrial control system network into logical layers, from the factory floor (Level 0) to the enterprise IT network (Level 5). It's important because it provides a blueprint for segmenting a network and placing security controls at each level to prevent attacks from spreading.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">Defense in depth is a security strategy that uses multiple layers of security controls. If one layer fails, another layer is there to provide protection. In OT, this includes using firewalls, network segmentation, strong access controls, and physical security.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">A **vulnerability** is a weakness in a system that can be exploited (e.g., an unpatched software bug). A **threat** is a potential cause of harm, like a hacker or a piece of malware.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">Network segmentation divides the OT network into smaller, isolated zones. This stops an attacker from moving freely across the entire network. If one segment is compromised, the damage is contained and cannot easily spread to more critical areas.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">Patching an OT system can cause a process to stop, which leads to major financial losses and safety risks. Many OT systems are also old and may not be compatible with modern patches, and applying them could void the warranty from the vendor.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">Air-gapping means physically isolating a network from all other networks, including the internet. This provides the highest level of security against remote cyberattacks, as the only way to breach the network is with physical access.</p>

                        <p class="mb-2">A risk assessment helps an organization understand its most critical assets, the threats they face, and how likely an attack is. It helps prioritize security investments to protect what matters most, rather than spending money on less critical areas.</p>

                                <p class="mb-2">A supply chain attack involves a hacker injecting malicious code into hardware or software during its manufacturing or distribution. An attacker could compromise a vendor's software update, which is then unknowingly installed on many OT systems, giving the attacker a backdoor into the network.</p>

                                <p class="mb-2">While ransomware in IT encrypts data, in OT it often targets operational processes. A hacker can use ransomware to shut down a manufacturing line or a power plant and demand a ransom to restore operations, causing physical disruption rather than just data loss.</p>

An attacker might send a phishing email to an OT engineer, who then clicks a malicious link, bypassing the network's technical defenses and giving the attacker a way into the system.</p>

Even though the OT systems were not directly hit, the company had to shut down the pipeline to contain the attack, which caused major fuel shortages.

                                <p class="mb-2">Triton was malware that targeted **Safety Instrumented Systems (SIS)**. The attack showed that hackers were no longer just trying to disrupt processes, but were actively trying to disable safety systems.

This was a clear example that OT systems are now a target for cyberattacks that can cause real-world disruption.</p>
